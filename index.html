      <h2>Education</h2>
      <div class="education greybox">
        <h3>2014 – 2017 University of Exeter</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated with a 2:1 in History, 2017. My three years there taught me a great deal including analysis of large sets of data, correct grammar and structuring, and to use creativity in shaping information into an argument.
        </p>
        <h3>April - June 2018 General Assembly: Web Development Immersive</h3>
        <p>
          The WDI course at GA takes people with very little to no coding knowledge and leaves them with enough understanding of up-to-date languages to feel confident applying for work as a junior developer. I can’t wait to apply what I’ve learnt from the course and to learn even more in this deep, ever-evolving industry.

        As a group of three we created a food waste sharing app, using the MEAN Stack, Google Maps API and Github for group project contribution. On login, users are taken to a map based on their location, where they can see markers indicating shared food in their local area. Users can then click on the item to see more details and to request collection.
